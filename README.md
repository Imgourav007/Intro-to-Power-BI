# Intro-to-Power-BI

## Problem Statement
Data professionals span a wide range of roles, locations, and experiences. To better understand their demographics, job satisfaction, and preferences, a global survey was conducted. The goal was to analyze this data and uncover patterns that can inform hiring strategies, compensation planning, and community engagement.

## Task
The dashboard was built using Power BI by cleaning and transforming raw survey data into actionable insights. Several visualizations were developed to capture various perspectives:  
*Country-wise distribution of respondents.  
*Average salary by job title and gender.  
*Popular programming languages among professionals.  
*Work-life balance and salary satisfaction metrics.  
*This dashboard allows HR teams, managers, and analysts to explore patterns in the data with interactive filtering and KPIs.
