# Intro-to-Power-BI

## Problem Statement
Data professionals span a wide range of roles, locations, and experiences. To better understand their demographics, job satisfaction, and preferences, a global survey was conducted. The goal was to analyze this data and uncover patterns that can inform hiring strategies, compensation planning, and community engagement.

## Task
The dashboard was built using Power BI by cleaning and transforming raw survey data into actionable insights. Several visualizations were developed to capture various perspectives:  
* Country-wise distribution of respondents.  
* Average salary by job title and gender.  
* Popular programming languages among professionals.  
* Work-life balance and salary satisfaction metrics.  
* This dashboard allows HR teams, managers, and analysts to explore patterns in the data with interactive filtering and KPIs.  

## Tools Used
* Power BI (Power Query, DAX, Visualizations).
* Excel (Data validation and preliminary analysis).

## Results
* Visualized global distribution of data professionals to identify geographic concentration.
* Analyzed salary variations across job titles and gender to inform compensation equity.
* Highlighted trending programming languages for talent development and recruitment focus.
* Presented work-life balance and salary satisfaction insights to support employee engagement initiatives.
* Enabled interactive exploration of survey data through dynamic filtering and KPIs, empowering stakeholders to make informed workforce decisions.
